# Visualizing Data with Leaflet

## Background

The objective of this challenge was to utilize `html` and `JavaScript` to visualize recent earthquake data from around the world.

## Basic Visualization

1. Data set obtained from [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

2. Save the data in a `JSON` file

3. Create a map using Leaflet plots of the earthquake data based on their longitude and latitude.  The map should include a legend and popups.

## More Data (Optional)

1. Plot a second data set on the map - for this purpose, used tetonic plate information.
2. Add multiple base maps to chose from that can be overlay and turned on or off.
3. Add layer controls to the map.
